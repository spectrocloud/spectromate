# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome, and thank you for expressing interest in contributing. If you are unsure or afraid of anything, feel free to ask for help. You can submit a work-in-progress (WIP) pull request or file an issue with the parts you know. We will do our best to guide you in the right direction and let you know if there are guidelines you will need to follow. We want people to be able to participate without fear of doing the wrong thing.

Below are our expectations for contributors. Following these guidelines gives us the best opportunity to work with you, by making sure we have the things we need to make it happen.

1. Open an issue. This allows for discussion to occur before starting and prevents you from working on anything that could get rejected.

2. Ensure you write test cases for your contributions.

3. Follow the [Development Environment](development.md) guide to get started.
