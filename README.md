## Overview 👩‍🚀 🧑‍🚀 🧑🏿‍🚀

SpectroMate is an API server with extended functionality designed for Slack integration in the form of a bot. You can use SpectroMate to handle [slash commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands), and [message actions](https://api.slack.com/reference/interaction-payloads). You can also use SpectroMate to handle non-slack-related events by creating API endpoints for other purposes. 

SpectroMate is designed for deployment in [Palette](https://console.spectrocloud.com) using the Palette Dev Engine (PDE). Using simplifies the management and deployment of SpectroMate.
